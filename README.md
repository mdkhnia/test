# test
it's for testing android stuffs

For Login and Register, we used Backtory Users Services

For  weather, Yahoo's api used with Retrofit

We have used TextInputLayout and some MaterialDesign features for making our UI Design

Also a few examples of using Hawk and Picasso Libraries are added

and we designed an Intro without using any libraries, so you could learn to work with ViewPagers.

also there are some cool stuff in this app, that I didn't mention, so go see for yourself :-)
